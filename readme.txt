Super flexible Twitter plugin for displaying tweets on your blog
== Description ==

It seems like every twitter plugin for WP does one of two things- pushes your blog posts to twitter, or shows your own tweets on your site.

I wanted to show tweets of the people I follow on my sidebar, and it seemed like it hadn't been covered yet. Fortunately I knew of an awesome jQuery plugin, Seaofclouds Tweet! - http://tweet.seaofclouds.com/-
that lets you not only show tweets from a twitter list, but also from a search query, and of course just from a specific user. You can customize appearance with CSS and custom templates that control the content
that appears in the tweets.

A quick port to WP and you now can have all this flexibility from the Settings->Tweet! menu in your WP Admin. Add tweet feeds from the settings page and then add them to your site using the widget or shortcode.

Details on shortcode and custom template use are found on the settings page.

== Installation ==

Easiest way to install is to click Plugins->Add New in WP Admin, search for seaofclouds tweet, click install and then activate.
